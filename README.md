#RSS Read-Aloud

## Work in Progress
  * This is a running React project. I wanted to be able to read the news in a hands-free manner while eating lunch.
  * There are still some news feeds that I would like to add but need to troubleshoot.

## To run the demo
  * Open http://www.carolchung.com/rss-read-aloud/
  * To play audio for headlines, click the play button.
  * To stop audio, click the pause button.

## To run locally
  * From the console, at the project root, run
  `grunt`

  * Also run a local webserver from the /public folder level. i.e.
  `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080`

  * If you do not run the application from a webserver, the voice-elements will not work and you will be able to view the RSS feeds text but the application will not play audio.
